    <h1>Come Craft with Me!</h1>
    <h2>Hi, fellow crafters! Welcome to my crafting journey where you can follow along as I explore new skills. I am excited to share my works with you! Hopefully, I can inspire a few of you to either try out a new hobby or get back to finishing up that old scarf you started to crochet during Covid that is still sitting in the back of your closet.</h2>

    <h3>More About Me</h3>
    <h2>My name is Jeannine and I am in my first year at UNC's School of Information and Library Science pursuing a master's in information science. I currently work in marketing and as legal assistant for a criminal defense law firm. With such a busy schedule, I find it important to carve out time for my own hobbies. As you can probably tell, those hobbies vary within the world of crafting. From pottery to cross-stitching, I have tried so many art forms, but there are so many avenues I still want to explore! </h2>
